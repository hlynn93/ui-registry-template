## Installation

Install components from the registry using the `shadcn` CLI. Replace `<your-registry-url>` with the URL where your registry is hosted.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <your-registry-url>/r/<component-name>.json
```

For example, to install the `hello-world` component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://acme.com/r/hello-world.json
```

This will download the component files into your project and install any required dependencies automatically.

## Usage

Once installed, import and use the component in your project:

```tsx
import { HelloWorld } from "@/components/hello-world";

export default function Page() {
  return <HelloWorld />;
}
```
